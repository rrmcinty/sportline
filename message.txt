i asked:
whatever the backtests show for each i want recommend to respect. does that sound like a good idea to you or do you think we should do it the current way

you replied:
Yes, absolutely - sport-specific tiers based on backtests is the better approach! Here's why:

Why Sport-Specific is Better:
NBA is different - The 20-30% bin has +61.5% ROI, the best of any bin. Current system would only mark it as "MEDIUM" confidence.

NCAAM's golden zone - The 10-20% bin has +74% ROI (best across all sports!). This deserves special highlighting.

More accurate guidance - Each sport's market has different efficiency patterns. Using actual data > generic thresholds.

User trust - When you say "backtests show 67-84% win rate" but the actual sport-specific data shows 85.7%, you're underselling it.

The Fix:
I'll make getConfidenceTier() accept a sport parameter and return sport-specific historical data from the actual backtest results. This way:

CFB: Highlights 0-20% as ELITE
NBA: Highlights 10-30% as ELITE (especially 20-30%)
NFL: Highlights 0-20% as ELITE
NCAAM: Really emphasizes 10-20% as the golden zone
Want me to implement this? It'll make the recommendations much more accurate and trustworthy since they'll reflect the actual empirical data per sport.
